# Medical Diagnosis Model for Heart Disease Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to develop a Medical Diagnosis System for predicting the likelihood of heart disease using Logistic Regression. The system is implemented in a Google Colab notebook, making it accessible and easy to use. The notebook utilizes a dataset containing relevant medical features to train and evaluate the logistic regression model, providing a valuable tool for early detection and intervention in heart-related issues.

## Introduction

Heart disease is a critical health concern globally, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. This project focuses on building a predictive model using logistic regression to assess the probability of an individual having heart disease based on various medical features.

## Features

The system considers a variety of features that are commonly associated with heart disease, including:

- Age
- Gender
- Chest pain type
- Resting blood pressure
- Serum cholesterol levels
- Fasting blood sugar
- Resting electrocardiographic results
- Maximum heart rate achieved
- Exercise-induced angina
- ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
- Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy
- Thallium stress test result

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model is sourced from [provide_dataset_source_link]. It contains a comprehensive set of anonymized patient data, enabling the logistic regression model to learn and generalize effectively.

## Google Colab Notebook

The code for this project is implemented in a Google Colab notebook, which can be accessed [here](https://github.com/PARTHXT1022/Heart-disease-Prediction-Model-using-Logistic-Regression-in-AI-ML/blob/main/Medical_Diagnosis_Mini_Project.ipynb). The notebook provides a step-by-step guide for loading the dataset, training the logistic regression model, and making predictions.

## Usage

To use the system:

1. Open the Google Colab notebook.
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to run each cell sequentially.
3. Input patient information as prompted to obtain the probability of the patient having heart disease based on the logistic regression model.

## Results

The system's performance and accuracy metrics are detailed within the Google Colab notebook. This document includes insights into the model's strengths, weaknesses, and potential areas for improvement.
